## Tests

No tests at this time.

## Installation

Setup: 
- (1) Fork the repo, (2) Clone the forked repo locally, (3) Run "npm install" (to install the dependencies).

Setup the Database Schema: 
- (1) Update or add an .env file. Include the fields below in the .env file. Note that the .env variables are used in the conf folder, connection.js file.

  Server-Side '.env`:
  * DB_NAME=integral-solutions

  Client-Side `.env`:
  * REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<key>
  * REACT_APP_TINY_URL_KEY=<key>

Seed the Database: 
- Run Server: From the root directory, run either "npm run watch" to start nodemon or "node server.js".
- Seed Database: (a) To create the database, run "SOURCE ./db/schema.sql" in mySQL, (b) To create the database tables, from the terminal, run "npm run start" or "npm run watch", (c) To seed the database tables, run "npm run seed" or "node ./seeds/index.js".

Note that the seed will also create entries for the user table including hashed passwords. When loggin into the app these user seeds can be used as test email address. Either obtain an email address from the user table (SELECT * FROM user;) or use an option noted below:

  * email: a@a.com, password: "12" (note role is employee)
  * email: b@b.com, password: "12" (note role is manager)

If you'd like to use NPM nodemon as/if you make changes to the code, please install nodemon as a development dependency using "npm install --save-dev nodemon" (see https://www.npmjs.com/package//nodemon).
